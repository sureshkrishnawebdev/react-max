1. Create a library-info project to xplore react concepts
    1.1. creating the basic route setup using routing concepts  
    - route, switch, exact
    - nested route, 
    - hooks - useParam 

    1.2. Implementing basic login and logout functionality
    - hooks 
        - useState - to toggle loggedin state + render contents conditionally
        - useHistory - to redirect post logout
        - useEffect - with empty dependency - to persist loggedIn state even on reload

    1.3. Implementing context for authentication
        - hooks 
            - useContext - used to obtain loggedIn state from store across application instead of prop chaining
        - component
            -refactoring: authentication state in single file 
                -lifting the logic(state, eventHandlers) to the  provider component 
                - removing the unwanted code from main file(library-info.js) to have lean components
