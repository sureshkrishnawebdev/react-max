1.1. JSX 
    - Its a syntax provided by React team to return html elements in an declarative way using js.
    - parent container - every jsx synatx must return only one parent container/element - (div/fragments)
    - dynamic data -- JSX provides - dynamic placeholders - 'curly brackets wraped around variable name/ expresssions' -- { varName/ expressions }
    - styling -- we need to declare css selector classes using - 'className' instead of 'class'
       
1.2. custom component
    - Naming -- Always name custom component with Camelcase or it should start with captial letter
             -- react considers 
                - lowercase - as in-built html elements
                - uppercase - as custom components
    - practise -- It's better to import React from 'react' - bcz it supports JSX syntax -- backward compatibility for < v.18 
    - Data transfer -- we use props 
        - whihc is one single parameter that holds all the data(arguments) from parent. (i.e. somewhat similar to ...rest operator) 
        - It's similar to normal js fns -- where we communicate btw fns via - arguments & params 
        - in the end components are nothing but fns in react - we apply same rule but slight chnage in syntax
