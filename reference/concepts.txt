/////////// ROUTES /////////////////
0. Installation -- To setup route we're going to use - react-router-dom@5 package
1. Creating routes for page
    1.1. define route
    1.2. activate route
    1.3. linking our route with links
        1.3.1. using default href 
        1.3.2. using Link - replacement of default
        1.3.3. using NavLink - addon with Link + shows activated route
        1.3.4. using Redirect - used mainly for landing page with domain name it redirects to specified route
        1.3.5. using exact  - it solves FIFO approach of routes 
                            - allows us to have multiple routes with same base route + helps for dynamic routes
